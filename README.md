A very simple pop out claculator that clings to the side of the screen and pops up when yoo move your mouse to the side of the screen.

Built using Co-Pilot in 30 mins or so. I was looking for a nice simple way to have a calculator on screen but also hidden away and easy to access when I want, rather than having to search for Calculator everytime. Detects current Window theme when started and matches style, light or dark.

Options to change the config:
Change the Size (48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
Change the Font (Arial, Tahoma, Calibri, Verdan, Sergoe UI)
Change the docking poistion (Left, Right, Top, Bottom)

The Calculator can be dragged on the side of the screen where it's docked (up/down, left/right) 

Copy/Paste buttons to copy the answer or paste a numeric value in.
